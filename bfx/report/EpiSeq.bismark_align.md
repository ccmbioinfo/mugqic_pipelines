### Read Alignment Per Readset Dataset
These are [Bismark]([@bismark]) reports for individual readsets are displayed. It may be helpful to review these results to determine if a problematic readset can contaminate the entire sample. If a readset is found to be causing a lot of issues, removing them from the experiment would allow the pipeline to merge the sample data, without the problem reads.
 
 In addition to alignment statistics, a nucleotide coverage report is given to help convey read depth and library coverage. The ideal values depend on the sequencing experiment and library, but in general, the read depth for covered loci should be high enough to be confident of any methylation calls.
